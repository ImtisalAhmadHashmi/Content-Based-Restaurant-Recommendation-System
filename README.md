# Content-Based-Restaurant-Recommendation-System
Built a content-based restaurant recommendation system in Python, achieving personalized suggestions by leveraging TF-IDF Vectorization and cosine similarity on combined textual and numerical features. Preprocessed a large dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, normalizing numerical attributes via MinMaxScaler, and treating outliers with the IQR method. Engineered feature representations by merging Cuisines, City, Currency, and Rating Text to enhance similarity detection. Converted categorical binary data for efficient processing. Enabled query-based recommendations on Restaurant Name, Cuisines, City, or Aggregate Ratings, optimizing retrieval performance and demonstrating expertise in NLP, data preprocessing, and recommendation algorithms.
